# KingsQuest-SocketIO-Angular-Express-Phaser
KingsQuest is a 8-bit MMORPG using BrowserQuests open source sprites. 
On the frontend side, this project uses Angular for the main page, and Phaser, an HTML5 framework for the game itself. 
Uses Express for the backend and SocketIO for multiplayer gameplay. 
As of now, I have implemented user creation (no database entries yet), 
chatting between other players (similar to Runescape's chat system), 
pathfinding using an A* pathfinding algorithm library for Phaser with collision detection, 
a very basic NPC interaction, and zone teleportation based on player position. 
The map was created using Tiled, a map generator.
